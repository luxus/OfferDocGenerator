# Configuration System Overview

## Purpose
The configuration system provides a flexible and maintainable way to manage document generation settings, variables, and internationalization options. It uses YAML format for configuration files and supports template-based document generation with multi-language support.

## Structure
The configuration system is organized into several key components:

1. **Base Configuration**: Core settings for paths, internationalization, and output formats
2. **Product Configuration**: Product-specific settings and variables
3. **Variable System**: Support for dynamic content insertion with multi-language capabilities
4. **Template System**: Document templates with variable placeholders

## Key Features
- Hierarchical configuration structure
- Multi-language support
- Flexible path configuration
- Template-based document generation
- Variable substitution system
